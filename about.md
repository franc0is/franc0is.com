Hello, I'm Fran√ßois :)

I currently **live** in San Francisco, California and **work** for
[Oculus/Facebook](http://oculus.com) as an embedded software engineer.

I'm an **immigrant**. I was born and raised in France, I am 1/2 Corsican, and I've
spent my adult life in the USA.

While I mostly focus on **hardware**, I'd like to write a bit about
internationalization and politics as well.

My pet peeve is websites that only accept ascii input for first & last names.

The easiest way to get in touch with me is via Twitter at
